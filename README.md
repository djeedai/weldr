weldr is a Rust library to manipulate [LDraw](https://www.ldraw.org/) files ([format specification](https://www.ldraw.org/article/218.html)), which are files describing 3D models of [LEGO®](http://www.lego.com)* pieces.

weldr allows building command-line tools and applications leveraging [the fantastic database of pieces](https://www.ldraw.org/cgi-bin/ptlist.cgi) contributed by the LDraw community.

## Example

Parse a single `.ldr` file containing 2 commands:

```rust
extern crate weldr;

use weldr::{parse_raw, CommandType, CommentCmd, LineCmd, Vec3};

fn main() {}

#[test]
fn test_weldr() {
  let cmd0 = CommandType::Comment(CommentCmd{ text: "this is a comment".to_string() });
  let cmd1 = CommandType::Line(LineCmd{
    color: 16,
    vertices: [
      Vec3{ x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0 },
      Vec3{ x: 1.0, y: 1.0, z: 1.0 }
    ]
  });
  assert_eq!(parse_raw(b"0 this is a comment\n2 16 0 0 0 1 1 1"), vec![cmd0, cmd1]);
}
```

## Documentation

[Reference documentation](https://docs.rs/weldr)

## Rust version requirements

weldr is tested with `rustc` **version 1.44**, **stable**, and **beta**, although older versions may work, but have never been tested.

## Installation

weldr is available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/weldr) and can be included in your Cargo enabled project like this:

```toml
[dependencies]
weldr = "0.1"
```

Then include it in your code like this:

```rust,ignore
extern crate weldr;
```

## Technical features

weldr leverages the [nom parser combinator library](https://crates.io/crates/nom) to efficiently and reliably parse LDraw files, and transform them into in-memory data structures for consumption. All parsing is done on `&[u8]` input expected to contain [specification](https://www.ldraw.org/article/218.html)-compliant LDraw content. In particular, this means:

- UTF-8 encoded input
- Both DOS/Windows `<CR><LF>` and Unix `<LF>` line termination accepted
