**weldr** is a Rust library and command-line tool to manipulate [LDraw](https://www.ldraw.org/) files ([format specification](https://www.ldraw.org/article/218.html)), which are files describing 3D models of [LEGO¬Æ](http://www.lego.com)* pieces.

This repository is a Cargo workspace composed of the following packages:

| Package | Version | Description | Path |
|---|---|---|---|
| [üì¶ `weldr`](https://crates.io/crates/weldr) | [![Crates.io Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/weldr.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/weldr) | The weldr Rust library | [`lib/`](./lib) |
| [üì¶ `weldr-bin`](https://crates.io/crates/weldr-bin) | [![Crates.io Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/weldr-bin.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/weldr-bin) | The ‚öô `weldr` command-line tool | [`bin/weldr/`](./bin/weldr) |

## Library

The `weldr` library allows building command-line tools and applications leveraging [the fantastic database of pieces](https://library.ldraw.org/) contributed by the LDraw community.

Parse the content of a single LDraw file containing 2 commands:

```rust
use weldr::*;

#[test]
fn test_weldr() {
  let cmd0 = CommandType::Comment(
    CommentCmd{ text: "this is a comment".to_string() }
  );
  let cmd1 = CommandType::Line(LineCmd{
    color: 16,
    vertices: [
      Vec3{ x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0 },
      Vec3{ x: 1.0, y: 1.0, z: 1.0 }
    ]
  });
  assert_eq!(
    parse_raw(b"0 this is a comment\n2 16 0 0 0 1 1 1"),
    vec![cmd0, cmd1]
  );
}
```

## Command-line tool

The ‚öô `weldr` command-line tool is an executable to manipulate LDraw files and convert them to other formats (currently: glTF 2.0 only).

Convert an LDraw file to a glTF 2.0 file:

```shell
weldr convert gltf 5-8cyli.dat --output 5-8cyli.gltf
```

The format is:

```shell
weldr <COMMAND> <INPUT>
```

You can get the list of commands with `weldr --help`. Currently only the `convert` command is implemented for the `gltf` (glTF 2.0) format.

```shell
weldr convert [OPTIONS] gltf <INPUT>
```

The official LDraw catalog of parts is available at <https://library.ldraw.org/library/updates/complete.zip>. When using it, use the `--catalog-path` to specify the location where it was downloaded, to allow ‚öô `weldr` to resolve files and all their sub-file references. By default the current working directory is used.
